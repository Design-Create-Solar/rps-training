# rps-training

Training repository for DCS: Software.
Participants are tasked to design an application that allows users to play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.
Visual frameworks and components are left to the discretion of the developer.

#### Requirements

Functionality should support the following:

- The program clearly uses React (not vanilla Javascript).
- The program can be compiled and launched locally to a webpage (i.e. http://localhost:3000/)
- The user must be able to choose one out of three options (rock, paper, or scissors).
- The computer should respond with its option, and the website should say whether the CPU wins, loses, or it's a tie.
- The computer should be capable of picking any of the three options in any scenario (you can't just hardcode that it will just choose Rock).

It will not be tested:

- Whether the computer has multiple levels of complexity to its selection algorithm (only one simple one will do).
- Whether the logs are shown on the webpage, or in console.
- Whether the CPU will always win, lose, or tie. In short, as long as there is a win/lose condition, it is sufficient.

#### Environment

For this repository, we will be using **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** to automatically set build preconfigurations (Webpack & Babel) for React development.
Main benefits:

- Minimalistic build
- Simple deployment
- Client-side rendering & lack of SEO support will not impact performance.

To get started,
- Clone the repository by typing in `git clone https://
